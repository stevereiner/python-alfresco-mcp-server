# Debug Test Files

This directory contains one-off debug and development test files that are not part of the main testing suite.

These files were moved from the root directory to clean up the project structure:

- `test_additional_clients.py` - Testing additional client imports
- `test_fixed_auth.py` - Authentication testing
- `test_mcp_direct.py` - Direct MCP testing
- `test_mcp_tools.py` - MCP tools testing  
- `test_sse_endpoint.py` - SSE endpoint testing
- `test_update_debug.py` - Update debugging
- `test_update_direct.py` - Direct update testing

These are development/debugging tools and not included in the main test suite in `/tests/`.
